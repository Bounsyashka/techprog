# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. 
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the task5 branch
  push:
    branches: [ task5 ]
  # --- pull_request:
  # ---   branches: [ task5 ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
